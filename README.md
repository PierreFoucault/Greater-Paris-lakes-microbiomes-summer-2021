"A summer in the Greater Paris: trophic status of peri-urban lakes shapes prokaryotic community structure and functional potential"

Foucault et al., 2024 DOI:

Abstract:
In the context of global change, understanding how anthropogenic pressures affect aquatic ecosystem’s community functioning across space and over time is a major challenge for ecologists.
With more than 12 million inhabitants, the Greater Paris offers a “natural laboratory” to explore the effects of eutrophication on freshwater lakes within a relatively restricted area.
Here, a four-month time-series was carried out during summertime to monitor planktonic microbial communities of nine lakes located within a ~70 km radius around Paris (Île-de-France, France)
of comparable morphologies, yet distinct trophic statuses (mesotrophic to hypereutrophic).
The contribution of the trophic status and intra-summer variations were investigated on prokaryotic community structures (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and functions (shotgun metagenomic).
Sampled lakes harbored highly distinct and diverse prokaryotic communities despite their spatial proximity.
Although their gene pool was quite stable and shared among lakes, taxonomical and functional changes were correlated. The trophic status appears as the main driver of both community structure and functional potential.
When focusing on function involved in biogeochemical cycles, responses to phosphorus limitation (mostly polyphosphate-related processess) were highlighted between trophic statuses.
Hypereutrophic lakes communities displayed the highest contrast and heterogeneity over time, suggesting a “regime shift” compared to lakes of lower trophic status.
This study explores the influence of eutrophication on lakes’ microbiome ecology,
by comparing for the first time the planktonic microbial communities and their functional potential of lakes of distinct trophic status in close vicinity over a summer season.
